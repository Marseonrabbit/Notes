The OSI model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement network communications. It has **7 layers**, each with distinct functions.
## OSI Model Layers Table

| Layer No. | Layer Name         | Function                                           | Examples                                  |
|-----------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 7         | Application         | Interfaces with user and provides network services | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS                      |
| 6         | Presentation        | Data formatting, encryption/decryption, compression| SSL/TLS, JPEG, MP3, ASCII                 |
| 5         | Session             | Manages sessions and controls dialogue             | NetBIOS, RPC, APIs                        |
| 4         | Transport           | Reliable data transfer, error recovery             | TCP, UDP, Port Numbers                    |
| 3         | Network             | Routing and logical addressing                     | IP, ICMP, Routers                         |
| 2         | Data Link           | Framing, physical addressing, error detection      | MAC Address, Ethernet, Switches          |
| 1         | Physical            | Transmits raw bits over medium                     | Cables, Hubs, NIC, Electrical signals     |
