# Transmission Media

In any form of communication, a medium is required for transmitting information. Transmission media are critical for network performance, reliability, capacity, and coverage. They can be categorized as **wired** or **wireless**.

## Wired Transmission Media

Wired media physically connect network elements. Common types include:

### Copper Wires
- Traditionally used due to low electrical resistance.
- Susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI) and require insulation.

### Twisted Pair
- **Structure**: Two insulated copper wires twisted around each other to reduce EMI and radio frequency noise.
- **Use**: Widely deployed in telephone networks for voice data (low cost, easy installation).
- **Limitations**: Poor scalability for LANs in terms of transmission rate, distance, and bandwidth.
- **Figure**: Twisted Pair (Fig. 1.8).

### Coaxial Cables
- **Structure**: Inner conductor (solid/stranded copper) + insulation + outer conductor (braided/folded metal) + protective sheath.
- **Types**: 
  - **Thinnet**: Light, flexible, and inexpensive.
  - **Thicknet**: Durable, supports longer distances and higher signal capacity.
- **Use**: Television transmissions and long-distance communication.
- **Figure**: Coaxial Cable (Fig. 1.9).

### Optical Fiber
- **Structure**: Glass/plastic core + cladding (reflects light) + protective jacket.
- **Advantages**: 
  - Extremely high bandwidth, minimal EMI, and long-distance support.
- **Disadvantages**: High cost and installation complexity.
- **Transmission**: Data converted to light signals via LED or ILD; received by photodetector.
- **Figure**: Optical Fiber (Fig. 1.10).

## Wireless Communication

Wireless networks enable mobility and fall into three categories:

### Wireless Network Types
1. **Restricted Proximity Network**: Mix of fixed and wireless devices (e.g., LANs).
2. **Intermediate/Extended Network**: Fixed LANs connected wirelessly (e.g., inter-building links).
3. **Mobile Network**: Fully wireless connection (e.g., cellular/satellite links to fixed networks).

### Wireless Media Types

#### Infrared
- **Mechanism**: Transmits coded infrared light pulses (line-of-sight required).
- **Range**: Up to 100 feet.
- **Bandwidth**: Up to 10 Mbps (ideal for small areas).

#### High-Frequency Radio (RF)
- **Mechanism**: Uses radio waves; signals can bounce off surfaces.
- **Use**: Mobile computing and long-distance communication (with satellites).

#### Microwave
- **Mechanism**: Focused directional waves via parabolic antennas.
- **Types**:
  - **Terrestrial**: Ground-based, short-range.
  - **Satellite**: Long-distance via satellite refraction.

#### Laser
- **Mechanism**: Transmits data via focused laser light (line-of-sight required).
- **Use**: Similar to microwaves but over optical fibers or air (limited by obstacles).
