In February, 2002, the Internet security watch group CERT Coordination Center disclosed that global networks, including the Internet, phone systems, and the elec- trical power grid, are vulnerable to attack because of weakness in programming in a small but key network component. The component, an Abstract Syntax Notation One, or ASN.1, is a communication protocol used widely in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). 

There was widespread fear among government, networking manufacturers, security researchers, and IT executives because the component is vital in many communication grids, including national critical infrastructures such as parts of the Internet, phone systems, and the electrical power grid. These networks were vulner- able to disruptive buffer overflow and malformed packet attacks. 

This example illustrates but one of many potential incidents that can cause widespread fear and panic among government, networking manufacturers, security researchers, and IT executives when they think of the consequences of what might happen to the global networks. 

The number of threats is rising daily, yet the time window to deal with them is rapidly shrinking. Hacker tools are becoming more sophisticated and powerful. Currently, the average time between the point at which a vulnerability is announced and when it is actually deployed in the wild is getting shorter and shorter. 

Traditionally, security has been defined as a process to prevent unauthorized access, use, alteration, theft, or physical damage to an object through maintaining high confidentiality and integrity of information about the object and making infor- mation about the object available whenever needed. However, there is a common fallacy, taken for granted by many, that a perfect state of security can be achieved; they are wrong. There is nothing like a secure state of any object, tangible or not because no such object can ever be in a perfectly secure state and still be useful. An object is secure if the process can maintain its highest intrinsic value. Since the intrinsic value of an object depends on a number of factors, both internal and external to the object during a given time frame, an object is secure if the object assumes its maximum intrinsic value under all possible conditions. The process of security, therefore, strives to maintain the maximum intrinsic value of the object at all times. 

Information is an object. Although it is an intangible object, its intrinsic value can be maintained in a high state, thus ensuring that it is secure. Since our focus in this book is on global computer network security, we will view the security of this global network as composed of two types of objects: the tangible objects such as the servers, clients, and communication channels and the intangible object such as information that is stored on servers and clients and that moves through the com- munication channels.

Ensuring the security of the global computer networks requires maintaining the highest intrinsic value of both the tangible objects and information – the intangible one. Because of both internal and external forces, it is not easy to maintain the highest level of the intrinsic value of an object. These forces con- stitute a security threat to the object. For the global computer network, the secu- rity threat is directed to the tangible and the intangible objects that make up the global infrastructure such as servers, clients, communication channels, files, and information. 

The threat itself comes in many forms, including viruses, worms, distributed denial of services, electronic bombs, and derives many motives, including revenge, personal gains, hate, and joy rides, to name but a few.

## Sources of Security Threats

The security threat to computer systems springs from a number of factors that include weaknesses in the network infrastructure and communication protocols that create an appetite and a challenge to the hacker mind, the rapid growth of cyberspace into a vital global communication and business network on which international commerce and business transactions are increasingly being performed and many national critical infrastructures are being connected, the growth of the hacker community whose members are usually experts at gaining unauthorized access into systems that run not only companies and governments but also criti- cal national infrastructures, the vulnerability in operating system protocols whose services run the computers that run the communication network, the insider effect resulting from workers who steal and sell company databases and the mailing lists or even confidential business documents, social engineering, physical theft from within the organizations of things such as laptop and hand-held computers with powerful communication technology and more potentially sensitive information, and security as a moving target.

## Design Philosophy

Although the design philosophy on which both the computer network infrastruc- ture and communication protocols built has tremendously boosted were cyberspace development, the same design philosophy has been a constant source of the many ills plaguing cyberspace. The growth of the Internet and cyberspace in general was based on an open architecture work in progress philosophy. This philosophy attracted the brightest minds to get their hands dirty and contribute to the infrastruc- ture and protocols. With many contributing their best ideas for free, the Internet grew in leaps and bounds. This philosophy also helped the spirit of individualism and adventurism, both of which have driven the growth of the computer industry and underscored the rapid and sometimes motivated growth of cyberspace. 

Because the philosophy was not based on clear blueprints, new developments and additions came about as reactions to the shortfalls and changing needs of a develop- ing infrastructure. The lack of a comprehensive blueprint and the demand-driven design and development of protocols are causing the ever present weak points and loopholes in the underlying computer network infrastructure and protocols. 

In addition to the philosophy, the developers of the network infrastructure and pro- tocols also followed a policy to create an interface that is as user-friendly, efficient, and transparent as possible so that all users of all education levels can use it unaware of the working of the networks and therefore are not concerned with the details. 

The designers of the communication network infrastructure thought it was better this way if the system is to serve as many people as possible. Making the interface this easy and far removed from the details, though, has its own downside in that the user never cares about and pays very little attention to the security of the system. 

Like a magnet, the policy has attracted all sorts of people who exploits the net- work’s vulnerable and weak points in search of a challenge, adventurism, fun, and all forms of personal gratification.

## Weaknesses in Network Infrastructure and Communication Protocols

Compounding the problems created by the design philosophy and policy are the weaknesses in the communication protocols. The Internet is a packet network that works by breaking the data to be transmitted into small individually addressed packets that are downloaded on the network’s mesh of switching elements. Each individual packet finds its way through the network with no predetermined route and the packets are reassembled to form the original message by the receiving ele- ment. To work successfully, packet networks need a strong trust relationship that must exist among the transmitting elements. 

As packets are di-assembled, transmitted, and re-assembled, the security of each individual packet and the intermediary transmitting elements must be guaranteed. This is not always the case in the current protocols of cyberspace. There are areas where, through port scans, determined users have managed to intrude, penetrate, fool, and intercept the packets. 

The two main communication protocols on each server in the network, UDP and TCP, use port numbers to identify higher layer services. Each higher layer service on a client uses a unique port number to request a service from the server and each server uses a port number to identify the service needed by a client. The cardinal rule of a secure communication protocol in a server is never to leave any port open in the absence of a useful service. If no such service is offered, its port should never be open. Even if the service is offered by the server, its port should never be left open unless it is legitimately in use. 

In the initial communication between a client and a server, the client addresses the server via a port number in a process called a three-way handshake. The three- way handshake, when successful, establishes a TCP virtual connection between the server and the client. This virtual connection is required before any communication between the two can begin. The process begins by a client/host sending a TCP seg- ment with the synchronize (SYN) flag set; the server/host responds with a segment that has the acknowledge valid (ACK) and SYN flags set, and the first host responds with a segment that has only the ACK flag set. This exchange is shown in Fig. 3.1. The three-way handshake suffers from a half-open socket problem when the server trusts the client that originated the handshake and leaves its port door open for fur- ther communication from the client. 

As long as the half-open port remains open, an intruder can enter the system because while one port remains open, the server can still entertain other three-way handshakes from other clients that want to communicate with it. Several half-open ports can lead to network security exploits including both TCP/IP and UDP Proto- cols: Internet Protocol spoofing (IP spoofing), in which IP addresses of the source element in the data packets are altered and replaced with bogus addresses, and SYN flooding where the server is overwhelmed by spoofed packets sent to it.

In addition to the three-way handshake, ports are used widely in network com- munication. There are well-known ports used by processes that offer services. For example, ports 0 through 1023 are used widely by system processes and other highly privileged programs. This means that if access to these ports is compromised, the intruder can get access to the whole system. Intruders find open ports via port scans. The two examples below from G-Lock Software illustrate how a port scan can be made.
- TCP connect( ) scanning• is the most basic form of TCP scanning. An attacker’s host is directed to issue a connect( ) system call to a list of selected ports on the target machine. If any of these ports is listening, connect( ) system call will succeed; otherwise, the port is unreachable and the service is unavailable. 
- UDP Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) port unreachable scanning• is one of the few UDP scans. Recall from Chapter 1 that UDP is a connectionless protocol; so, it is harder to scan than TCP because UDP ports are not required to respond to probes. Most implementations generate an ICMP port_unreachable error when an intruder sends a packet to a closed UDP port. When this response does not come, the intruder has found an active port. 

In addition to port number weaknesses usually identifiable via port scans, both TCP and UDP protocols suffer from other weaknesses. Packet transmissions between network elements can be intercepted and their contents altered such as in initial sequence number attack. Sequence numbers are integer numbers assigned to each transmitted packet, indicating their order of arrival at the receiving element. Upon receipt of the packets, the receiving element acknowledges it in a two-way communication session during which both the trans- mitting elements talk to each other simultaneously in full duplex. 

In the initial sequence number attack, the attacker intercepts the communication session between two or more communicating elements and then guesses the next sequence number in a communication session. The intruder then slips the spoofed IP addresses into the packets transmitted to the server. The server sends an acknowl- edgment to the spoofed clients. Infrastructure vulnerability attacks also include ses- sion attacks, packet sniffing, buffer overflow, and session hijacking. These attacks are discussed in later chapters. 

The infrastructure attacks we have discussed so far are of the penetration type where the intruder physically enters the system infrastructure, either at the transmit- ting element or in the transmitting channel levels, and alters the content of packets. In the next set of infrastructure attacks, a different approach of vulnerability exploi- tation is used. This is the distributed denial of services (DDoS). 

The DDoS attacks are attacks that are generally classified as nuisance attacks in the sense that they simply interrupt the services of the system. System interruption can be as serious as destroying a computer’s hard disk or as simple as using up all the available memory of the system. DDoS attacks come in many forms, but the most common are the following: smurfing, ICMP protocol, and ping of death attacks. The “smurf” attack utilizes the broken down trust relationship created by IP spoofing. An offending element sends a large amount of spoofed ping packets
