Creating security in the computer network model we are embarking on in this book means creating secure environments for a variety of resources. In this model, a resource is secure, based on the above definition, if that resource is protected from both internal and external unauthorized access. These resources, physical or not, are objects. Ensuring the security of an object means protecting the object from unauthorized access both from within the object and externally. In short, we protect objects. System objects are either tangible or nontangible. In a computer network model, the tangible objects are the hardware resources in the system, and the intan- gible object is the information and data in the system, both in transition and static in storage.

## Hardware

Protecting hardware resources include protecting 
- End user objects that include the user interface hardware components such as• all client system input components, including a keyboard, mouse, touch screen, light pens, and others. 
- Network objects like firewalls, hubs, switches, routers and gateways which are• vulnerable to hackers. 
- Network communication channels to prevent eavesdroppers from intercepting• network communications

## Software

Protecting software resources includes protecting hardware-based software, oper- ating systems, server protocols, browsers, application software, and intellectual property stored on network storage disks and databases. It also involves protecting client software such as investment portfolios, financial data, real estate records, images or pictures, and other personal files commonly stored on home and business computers
