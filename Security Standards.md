The computer network model also suffers from the standardization problem. Secu- rity protocols, solutions, and best practices that can secure the computer network model come in many different types and use different technologies resulting in incompatibility of interfaces (more in Chapter 16), less interoperability, and unifor- mity among the many system resources with differing technologies within the sys- tem and between systems. System managers, security chiefs, and experts, therefore, choose or prefer standards, if no de facto standard exists, that are based on service, industry, size, or mission. The type of service offered by an organization determines the types of security standards used. Like service, the nature of the industry an organization is in also determines the types of services offered by the system, which in turn determines the type of standards to adopt. The size of an organization also determines what type of standards to adopt. In relatively small establishments, the ease of implementation and running of the system influence the standards to be adopted. Finally, the mission of the establishment also determines the types of stan- dards used. For example, government agencies have a mission that differs from that of a university. These two organizations, therefore, may choose different standards. We are, therefore, going to discuss security standards along these divisions. Before we do that, however, let us look at the bodies and organizations behind the formula- tion, development, and maintenance of these standards. These bodies fall into the following categories:

- International organizations such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF),• the Institute of Electronic and Electric Engineers (IEEE), the International Standards Organization (ISO), and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU)
- Multinational organizations like the European Committee for Standardization• (CEN), Commission of European Union (CEU), and European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). 
- National governmental organizations like the National Institute of Standards• and Technology (NIST), American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and Canadian Standards Council (CSC). 
- Sector specific organizations such as the European Committee for Banking• Standards (ECBS), European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA), and Institute of Electronic and Electric Engineers (IEEE). 
- Industry standards such as RSA, the Open Group (OSF + X/Open), Object• Management Group (OMG), World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)), and the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS). Other sources of standards in security and cryptography.• 

Each one of these organizations has a set of standards. Table 2.1 shows some of these standards. In the table, x is any digit between 0 and 9.

## Security Standards Based on Type of Service/Industry

System and security managers and users may choose a security standard to use based on the type of industry they are in and what type of services that industry provides. Table 2.2 shows some of these services and the corresponding security standards that can be used for these services.

Let us now give some details of some of these standards

### Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)

In order to provide a basis and a catalyst for interoperable security based on public-key cryptographic techniques, the Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) were estab- lished. These are recent security standards, first published in 1991 following discussions of a small group of early adopters of public-key technology. Since their establishment, they have become the basis for many formal standards and are implemented widely. In general, PKCS are security specifications produced by RSA Laboratories in cooperation with secure systems developers worldwide for the purpose of acceler- ating the deployment of public-key cryptography. In fact, worldwide contributions from the PKCS series have become part of many formal and de facto standards, including ANSI X9 documents, PKIX, SET, S/MIME, and SSL.
