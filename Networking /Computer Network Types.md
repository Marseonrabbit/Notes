## Overview

Computer networks vary in size and are categorized based on the extent of their geographical coverage. The main types are Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs), with Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) falling in between.

## Local Area Networks (LANs)

- **Definition**: A network confined to a small geographical area, such as a building or a few adjacent buildings.
- **Advantages**:
  - High-speed data movement due to close proximity of network elements.
  - Use of high-quality communication elements for better service and reliability.
- **Example**: A network within a single office building.

## Wide Area Networks (WANs)

- **Definition**: A network covering a large geographical area, such as a region, country, or globally (e.g., the Internet).
- **Advantages**:
  - Distributes services to a wider community.
  - Offers a wide array of hardware and software resources.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Communication media can be slow and unreliable due to the vast area covered.

## Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs)

- **Definition**: Covers a larger area than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, typically a city or part of a city.
- **Example**: Civic networks within a city.
- **Note**: Often overshadowed by LANs and WANs, MANs are less frequently discussed.

These network types serve different purposes and have unique characteristics that cater to various communication and resource-sharing needs.
