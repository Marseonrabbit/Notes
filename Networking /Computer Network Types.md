## Overview

Computer networks come in different sizes. Each network is a cluster of network elements and their resources. The size of the cluster determines the network type. There are, in general, two main network types: the local area network (LAN) and wide area network (WAN).

## Local Area Networks (LANs)

- A computer network with two or more computers or clusters of network and their resources connected by a communication medium sharing communication proto- cols and confined in a small geographical area, such as a building floor, a building, or a few adjacent buildings, is called a local area network (LAN). The advantage of a LAN is that all network elements are close together so the communication links maintain a higher speed of data movement. Also, because of the proximity of the communicating elements, high-cost and high quality communicating elements can be used to deliver better service and high reliability.

## Wide Area Networks (WANs)

- A wide area network (WAN), on the other hand, is a network made up of one or more clusters of network elements and their resources but instead of being con- fined to a small area, the elements of the clusters or the clusters themselves are scattered over a wide geographical area as in a region of a country or across the whole country, several countries, or the entire globe like the Internet for example. Some advantages of a WAN include distributing services to a wider community and availability of a wide array of both hardware and software resources that may not be available in a LAN. However, because of the large geographical areas covered by WANs, communication media are slow and often unreliable. Figure 1.5 shows a WAN network.

## Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs)

- Between the LAN and WAN, there is also a middle network called the metropolitan area network (MAN) because it covers a slightly wider area than the LAN but not so wide as to be considered a WAN. Civic networks that cover a city or part of a city are a good example of a MAN. MANs are rarely talked about because they are quiet often overshadowed by cousin LAN to the left and cousin WAN to the right.
