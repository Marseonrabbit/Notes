In any communication network, a **transmission medium** is required to connect devices and allow them to exchange data. The medium plays a crucial role in determining the performance, reliability, and capacity of the network. Transmission media can be divided into two main categories: **wired** and **wireless** .

### 1. **Wired Transmission Media**

Wired media physically connect devices in a network. Here are the most common types:
#### **(a) Copper Wires**

- **How It Works** : Copper wires carry electrical signals.
- **Pros** :
    - Low resistance allows signals to travel far.
    - Inexpensive.
- **Cons** :
    - Sensitive to electromagnetic interference (EMI).
    - Requires insulation to reduce interference.

---
#### **(b) Twisted Pair Cables**

- **How It Works** : Two insulated copper wires are twisted together to reduce interference.
- **Pros** :
    - Reduces electromagnetic interference (EMI).
    - Affordable and easy to install.
    - Supports full-duplex communication (send and receive data simultaneously).
- **Cons** :
    - Limited bandwidth and distance.
    - Not ideal for high-speed networks like modern LANs.

#### **(c) Coaxial Cables**

- **How It Works** : A central copper wire is surrounded by insulation, an outer conductor, and a protective sheath.
- **Types** :
    - **Thinnet** : Light, flexible, and inexpensive.
    - **Thicknet** : Thicker, more durable, and supports longer distances.
- **Pros** :
    - Better than twisted pairs for long-distance communication.
    - Commonly used in TV and internet connections.
- **Cons** :
    - Bulkier and more expensive than twisted pairs.

#### **(d) Optical Fiber Cables**

- **How It Works** : Data is transmitted as light signals through thin glass or plastic fibers.
- **Structure** :
    - **Core** : Thin glass/plastic that carries the light.
    - **Cladding** : Reflects light back into the core.
    - **Jacket** : Protects the fiber from damage.
- **Pros** :
    - Extremely high bandwidth.
    - Immune to electromagnetic interference (EMI).
    - Can transmit data over long distances (several kilometers).
- **Cons** :
    - Expensive and difficult to install.
    - Fragile compared to copper cables.

### 2. **Wireless Transmission Media**

Wireless media use air or space to transmit data without physical connections. Wireless networks are categorized based on their range and purpose.

#### **(a) Infrared**

- **How It Works** : Devices communicate using pulses of infrared light.
- **Pros** :
    - Fast and reliable within a small area (e.g., TV remotes).
    - Supports high bandwidth (up to 10 Mbps).
- **Cons** :
    - Requires line-of-sight (no obstacles).
    - Limited range (up to 100 feet).

---
#### **(b) High-Frequency Radio Waves (RF)**

- **How It Works** : Devices communicate using electromagnetic radio waves.
- **Pros** :
    - Can travel long distances and penetrate walls/buildings.
    - No need for line-of-sight.
- **Cons** :
    - Signals can weaken over long distances.
    - Susceptible to interference.

---
#### **(c) Microwaves**

- **How It Works** : Uses high-frequency radio waves focused in a single direction.
- **Types** :
    - **Terrestrial Microwaves** : Used for ground-based communication.
    - **Satellite Microwaves** : Uses satellites to relay signals over long distances.
- **Pros** :
    - Highly directional and secure.
    - Supports long-distance communication.
- **Cons** :
    - Requires precise alignment of antennas.
    - Weather conditions can affect signals.

---
#### **(d) Laser**

- **How It Works** : Uses laser beams to transmit data through the air or optical fibers.
- **Pros** :
    - High-speed data transmission.
    - Can cover several thousand yards.
- **Cons** :
    - Requires line-of-sight.
    - Weather and obstacles can disrupt signals.

### Types of Wireless Networks

Wireless networks are classified based on their coverage area:

1. **Restricted Proximity Network** :
    
    - Example: Wi-Fi in homes or offices.
    - Combines wired and wireless devices in a small area.
2. **Intermediate/Extended Network** :
    
    - Example: Two buildings connected via a wireless bridge.
    - Covers larger areas but still limited.
3. **Mobile Network** :
    
    - Example: Cellular networks (4G, 5G).
    - Fully wireless, connects mobile devices to fixed networks.

### Why Choose Wired or Wireless?

- **Wired Media** :
    
    - Best for stable, high-speed, and secure connections.
    - Used in fixed networks like offices or data centers.
- **Wireless Media** :
    
    - Provides mobility and flexibility.
    - Ideal for environments where physical cables are impractical.

### Summary

- **Wired Media** :
    - Includes copper wires, twisted pairs, coaxial cables, and optical fibers.
    - Reliable and secure but less flexible.
- **Wireless Media** :
    - Includes infrared, radio waves, microwaves, lasers, and satellite communication.
    - Offers mobility but can be affected by interference and obstacles.
- The choice of medium depends on factors like distance, speed, cost, and environment.
