- There are several configuration models that form a computer network. The most common of these are the centralized and distributed models. In a centralized model, several computers and devices are interconnected, and can talk to each other. However, there is only one central computer, called the master, through which all correspondence must take place. Dependent computers, called surro- gates, may have reduced local resources, such as memory, and sharable global resources are controlled by the master at the center. Unlike the centralized model, however, the distributed network consists of loosely coupled comput- ers interconnected by a communication network consisting of connecting ele- ments and communication channels. The computers themselves may own their resources locally or may request resources from a remote computer. These com- puters are known by a string of names, including host, client, or node. If a host has resources that other hosts need, then that host is known as a server. Commu- nication and sharing of resources are not controlled by the central computer but are arranged between any two communicating elements in the network. Figures 1.2 and 1.3 show a crntralized network model and a distributed network model, respectively.
