Computer networks can be configured using various models. The most common are the centralized and distributed models.
## Centralized Model

- **Structure**: Multiple computers and devices are interconnected and communicate through a single central computer, known as the master.
- **Dependencies**: Surrogate computers may have limited local resources and rely on the master for global resource control.
- **Communication**: All interactions must pass through the master.

## Distributed Model

- **Structure**: Loosely coupled computers connected via a communication network consisting of connecting elements and channels.
- **Resource Ownership**: Computers can own resources locally or request them from remote computers.
- **Terminology**: Computers are referred to as hosts, clients, or nodes. A host providing resources to others is called a server.
- **Communication**: Resource sharing and communication occur directly between any two elements without central control.

These models highlight different approaches to managing resources and communication within a network.
