### 1. **Centralized Network Model**

- **What it is:** Think of this like a classroom where the teacher (the "master" computer) is in charge. All students (other computers or devices, called "surrogates") can talk to each other, but only through the teacher.
- **How it works:**
    - The teacher controls everything, like who gets to use the books (resources).
    - Students don’t have many books of their own; they rely on the teacher for most things.
    - If one student wants to share something with another student, they must ask the teacher first.
- **Example:** Imagine a school where all the students need to ask the teacher for permission to borrow a book from the library. The teacher decides who gets what and when.

### 2. **Distributed Network Model**

- **What it is:** This is more like a group of friends hanging out. Each friend (a "host" or "node") can talk directly to any other friend without needing someone in charge.
- **How it works:**
    - Each friend can have their own stuff (resources) or borrow stuff from others.
    - If one friend has something cool (like a game), they can share it directly with another friend.
    - There’s no single boss; everyone talks directly to each other.
- **Example:** Imagine a group of friends sharing snacks at a picnic. If one friend has chips and another has soda, they can trade or share without asking anyone else for permission.

### Key Differences:

- **Centralized Model:** One boss (central computer) controls everything. Everyone depends on the boss to share resources.
- **Distributed Model:** No boss. Everyone can share and communicate directly with each other.

### Visualizing It:

- **Centralized Model:** Picture a star with one big center point (the master) and lines connecting it to smaller points (the surrogates). Everything goes through the center.
- **Distributed Model:** Picture a web where every point (computer) is connected to several others. Resources and communication can happen between any two points directly.

### Summary:

- **Centralized:** One central computer (master) controls everything. Other computers (surrogates) depend on it.
- **Distributed:** Many computers (hosts/nodes) are connected, and they can share resources and communicate directly without a central controller.
