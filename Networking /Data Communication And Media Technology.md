`When we send information over a network, it needs to be converted into a signal that can travel through the chosen medium (like wires or air). The type of signal depends on the medium:+

- **Analog Signals** : These are continuous waves, like sound or radio waves. They are often used for things like voice and video.
- **Digital Signals** : These are sequences of binary data (0s and 1s) sent as voltage pulses. Computers use digital signals because they "think" in binary.

 `Depending on the medium, data can be sent as either analog or digital signals. For example:

- **Copper wires** , **fiber optics** , or **wireless signals** can carry both analog and digital data.
- Some media, like old telephone lines, may only support analog signals.

#### How Data is Sent
- **Analog Format** : Data is sent as continuous waves (like sound or video) over media such as copper wires, fiber optics, or wireless signals.
- **Digital Format** : Data is sent as binary bits (0s and 1s), represented by voltage changes. This is how computers communicate.

Both analog and digital data can be converted into either analog or digital signals for transmission.

### Encoding Schemes

Before data can be transmitted, it needs to be encoded into a format suitable for the medium. There are two main encoding schemes:

1. **Analog Encoding** : Used for analog data like sound or voice. It sends continuous waves.
2. **Digital Encoding** : Used for digital data like binary streams. It sends signals using two voltage levels to represent 0s and 1s.
### Summary

- **Transmission Technology** : Determines how data is sent (analog or digital).
- **Media** : The physical path (wires, fiber optics, wireless) through which data travels.
- **Encoding** : Converts data into signals (analog or digital) for transmission.
- **Digital Networks** : Modern networks focus on sending binary data (0s and 1s).

This is the foundation of how data moves across networks!
