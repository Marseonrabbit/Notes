When we talk about how data moves across networks, two important things come into play: **transmission technology** and the **media** used to carry that data. Let’s break these down in a simple way.

### 1. **Transmission Technology**

The way data is sent depends on the type of medium (or "path") it travels through. Think of it like sending a message—how you send it depends on whether you’re using a phone, email, or even smoke signals!

- **Analog Signals** : These are like smooth waves. They’re continuous and can represent things like voice or video. For example, when you talk on an old landline phone, your voice is converted into analog signals that travel through wires.
    
- **Digital Signals** : These are more like on/off switches. They use binary code (0s and 1s) to represent data. Digital signals are what computers use to communicate because they’re faster and more reliable.
    

Depending on the medium (like wires, fiber optics, or wireless), the data can be sent as either analog or digital signals. The process of converting data into these signals is called **encoding** .

### 2. **Media Types**

Now, let’s look at the different types of media that carry these signals:

1. **Copper Wires** : These are the traditional wires used in phone lines and older networks. They can carry both analog and digital signals but are limited in speed and distance.
    
2. **Twisted Pair Cables** : These are just like copper wires but twisted together to reduce interference. They’re commonly used in Ethernet cables for internet connections.
    
3. **Coaxial Cables** : These are thicker cables with a central copper wire surrounded by insulation. They’re often used for TV signals and can carry both analog and digital data.
    
4. **Fiber Optics** : These are super-fast cables that use light to transmit data. They’re great for long distances and high-speed internet because they don’t lose signal quality easily.
    
5. **Wireless** : This is where no physical wires are needed. Data is sent through the air using radio waves, like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. It’s convenient but can be affected by obstacles like walls or interference from other devices.

### Why Focus on Digital Networks?

In modern times, most networks are **digital** because they’re faster, more secure, and easier to work with. Computers and devices communicate using binary code (0s and 1s), so digital signals are a natural fit.

For example, when you send an email or stream a video, your computer converts the data into digital signals, which are then transmitted over the network using one of the media types mentioned above.

### Summary

- **Transmission Technology** : Determines how data is sent—either as analog (waves) or digital (binary code).
- **Media** : The physical or wireless path the data travels through, like wires, fiber optics, or air.
- **Encoding** : The process of converting data into signals that can be transmitted.

By understanding these basics, you can see how data moves across networks and why certain technologies are better suited for specific tasks.
