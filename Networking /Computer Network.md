## Introduction

In any form of communication, three essential components ensure effectiveness:

1. **Entities**: There must be a sender and a receiver who have information to share.
2. **Medium**: A transmission medium is necessary to convey the information.
3. **Rules**: Both parties must agree on a set of communication protocols.

These principles apply universally, including in computer networks.
## What is a Computer Network?

A computer network is a distributed system where various devices, known as network elements, communicate with each other through a shared medium. These devices follow established protocols to ensure effective communication.

### Key Components

- **Hardware**: Includes hosts (end systems) and intermediate elements like hubs, bridges, routers, and gateways. These elements can own resources either locally or globally.

- **Software**: Comprises application programs and network protocols that manage data synchronization, coordination, and sharing among network elements.

- **Users**: Individuals who exchange messages and share resources across different systems.

## Technology and Mechanisms

- **Internetworking**: This technology allows diverse hardware and software to interconnect, facilitating smooth communication across different networks.

- **Communication Mechanisms**:
  - **Low-Level**: Provided by the network elements.
  - **High-Level**: Facilitated by the software running on communicating devices.
