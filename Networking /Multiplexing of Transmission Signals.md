When transmitting data over a network, sometimes the amount of data is too large for the medium to handle at once. To solve this problem, we use **multiplexing** , which allows multiple signals to share the same transmission medium. There are two main types of multiplexing: **Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM)** and **Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)** .

### 1. **Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM)**

- **How It Works** :
    
    - In FDM, each data channel is first converted into an **analog signal** .
    - Each analog signal is then assigned a unique **frequency band** (like different radio stations).
    - These signals are combined and sent together over the same medium.
    - At the receiving end, a device called a **demultiplexer** separates the signals based on their frequencies and extracts the original data.
- **Example** :
    
    - Think of FDM like a highway with multiple lanes. Each lane carries a different type of vehicle (signal), but they all travel on the same road (medium).
- **Advantages** :
    
    - Supports **full-duplex communication** (data can be sent and received simultaneously).
    - Useful for analog signals like voice or radio.

### 2. **Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)**

- **How It Works** :
    
    - In TDM, the transmission medium is divided into **time slots** .
    - Each data stream gets a specific time slot to send its data.
    - The sender and receiver agree on the timing of these slots, so the receiver knows when to expect each signal.
    - Multiple digital signals are sent by taking turns in these time slots, like interleaving pieces of each signal.
- **Example** :
    
    - Imagine a single train track where multiple trains take turns using it. Each train (signal) has a scheduled time to use the track (medium).
- **Advantages** :
    
    - Efficient for **digital signals** .
    - Ensures that all data streams get equal access to the medium.

### Key Differences Between FDM and TDM

| Features                 | FDM                             | TDM                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Type of Signals**      | Works with analog signals       | Works with digital signals          |
| **How It Shares Medium** | Uses different frequency bands  | Uses time slots                     |
| **Best For**             | Analog data like voice or radio | Digital data like computer networks |
| **Full-Duplex Support**  | Yes                             | No (unless modified)                |

### Why Use Multiplexing?

Multiplexing helps make better use of the transmission medium by allowing multiple signals to share it. This is especially important when:

- The mediumâ€™s capacity is limited.
- We need to send multiple signals at the same time.
- We want to reduce costs by sharing resources.

### Summary

- **Multiplexing** allows multiple signals to share the same transmission medium.
- **FDM** divides the medium into different frequency bands for each signal.
- **TDM** divides the medium into time slots, giving each signal a turn to transmit.
- Both methods help improve efficiency and allow more data to be sent over a single medium.

This is how modern networks handle large amounts of data efficiently!
