A new movement was, therefore, born. It was called the open system movement, which called for computer hardware and software manufacturers to come up with a way for this to happen. But to make this possible, standardization of equipment and software was needed. To help in this effort and streamline computer communica- tion, the International Standards Organization (ISO) developed the Open System Interconnection (OSI) model. The OSI is an open architecture model that functions as the network communication protocol standard, although it is not the most widely used one. The Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model, a rival model to OSI, is the most widely used. Both OSI and TCP/IP models use two proto- col stacks, one at the source element and the other at the destination element.

## Open System Interconnection (OSI) Protocol Suite

The development of the OSI model was based on the secure premise that a communi- cation task over a network can be broken into seven layers, where each layer represents a different portion of the task. Different layers of the protocol provide different services and ensure that each layer can communicate only with its own neighboring layers. That is, the protocols in each layer are based on the protocols of the previous layers. Starting from the top of the protocol stack, tasks and information move down from the top layers until they reach the bottom layer where they are sent out over the network media from the source system to the destination. At the destination, the task or information rises back up through the layers until it reaches the top. Each layer is designed to accept work from the layer above it and to pass work down to the layer below it, and vice versa. To ease interlayer communication, the interfaces between the layers are standardized. However, each layer remains independent and can be designed independently and each layer’s functionality should not affect the functionalities of other layers above and below it. Table 1.1 shows an OSI model consisting of seven layers and the descriptions of the services provided in each layer. In peer-to-peer communication, the two communicating computers can initiate and receive tasks and data. The task and data initiated from each computer starts from the top in the application layer of the protocol stack on each computer. The tasks and data then move down from the top layers until they reach the bottom layer, where they are sent out over the network media from the source system to the destination. At the destination, the task and data rise back up through the layers until the top. Each layer is designed to accept work from the layer above it and pass work down to the layer below it. As data passes from layer to layer of the sender machine, layer headers are appended to the data, causing the datagram to grow larger. Each layer header contains information for that layer’s peer on the remote system. That information may indicate how to route the packet through the network or what should be done to the packet as it is handed back up the layers on the recipi- ent computer. Figure 1.17 shows a logical communication model between two peer com- puters using the ISO model. Table 1.2 shows the datagram with added header information as it moves through the layers. Although the development of the OSI model was intended to offer a standard for all other proprietary models, and it was as encompassing of all existing models as possible, it never really replaced many of those rival models it was intended to replace. In fact it is this “all in one” concept that led to market failure because it became too complex. Its late arrival on the market also prevented its much anticipated interoperability across networks.

## Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Model

Among the OSI rivals was the TCP/IP, which was far less complex and more his- torically established by the time the OSI came on the market. The TCP/IP model does not exactly match the OSI model. For example, it has two to three fewer levels than the seven layers of the OSI model. It was developed for the US Department of Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA); but over the years, it has seen a phenomenal growth in popularity and it is now the de facto standard for the Internet and many intranets. It consists of two major protocols: the transmission control protocol (TCP) and the Internet protocol (IP), hence the TCP/IP designa- tion. Table 1.3 shows the layers and protocols in each layer. Since TCP/IP is the most widely used in most network protocol suites by the Internet and many intranets, let us focus on its layers here.

### Application Layer

This layer, very similar to the application layer in the OSI model, provides the user interface with resources rich in application functions. It supports all network appli- cations and includes many protocols on a data structure consisting of bit streams as shown in Fig. 1.18

### Transport Layer

This layer, again similar to the OSI model session layer, is a slightly removed from the user and is hidden from the user. Its main purpose is to transport application layer messages that include application layer protocols in their headers between the host and the server. For the Internet network, the transport layer has two standard protocols: transport control protocol (TCP) and user datagram protocol (UDP). TCP provides a connection-oriented service, and it guarantees the delivery of all application layer packets to their destination. This guarantee is based on two mecha- nisms: congestion control that throttles the transmission rate of the source element when there is traffic congestion in the network and the flow control mechanism that tries to match sender and receiver speeds to synchronize the flow rate and reduce the packet drop rate. While TCP offers guarantees of delivery of the application layer packets, UDP, on the other hand, offers no such guarantees. It provides a no- frills connectionless service with just delivery and no acknowledgements. But it is much more efficient and a protocol of choice for real-time data such as streaming video and music. Transport layer delivers transport layer packets and protocols to the network layer. Figure 1.19 shows the TCP data structure, and Fig. 1.20 shows the UDP data structure.

### Network Layer

This layer moves packets, now called datagrams, from router to router along the path from a source host to the destination host. It supports a number of protocols including the Internet Protocol (IP), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP). The IP Protocol is the most widely used network layer protocol. IP uses header information from the transport layer protocols that include datagram source and destination port numbers from IP addresses, and other TCP header and IP information, to move datagrams from router to router through the network. Best routes are found in the network by using routing algorithms. Figure 1.21 shows the IP datagram structure. The standard IP address has been the so-called IPv4, a 32-bit addressing scheme. But with the rapid growth of the Internet, there was fear of running out of addresses, so IPv6, a new 64-bit addressing scheme, was created. The network layer conveys the network layer protocols to the data link layer.

### Data Link Layer

This layer provides the network with services that move packets from one packet switch like a router to the next over connecting links. This layer also offers reliable delivery of network layer packets over links. It is at the lowest level of communication, and it includes the network interface card (NIC) and operating system (OS) protocols. The protocols in this layer include: Ethernet, asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), and others such as frame relay. The data link layer protocol unit, the frame, may be moved over links from source to destination by different link layer protocols at different links along the way.

### Physical Layer

This layer is responsible for literally moving data link datagrams bit by bit over the links and between the network elements. The protocols here depend on and use the characteristics of the link medium and the signals on the medium.
