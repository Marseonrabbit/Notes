The performance of a network type depends greatly on the transmission technology and media used in the network. Let us look at these two.
## *Transmission Technology*

- The media through which information has to be transmitted determine the signal to be used. Some media permit only analog signals. Some allow both analog and digi- tal. Therefore, depending on the media type involved and other considerations, the input data can be represented as either digital or analog signal. In an analog format, data is sent as continuous electromagnetic waves on an interval representing things such as voice and video and propagated over a variety of media that may include copper wires, twisted coaxial pair or cable, fiber optics, or wireless. We will discuss these media soon. In a digital format, on the other hand, data is sent as a digital signal, a sequence of voltage pulses that can be represented as a stream of binary bits. Both analog and digital data can be propagated and many times represented as either analog or digital. Transmission itself is the propagation and processing of data signals between network elements. The concept of representation of data for transmission, either as analog or digital signal, is called an encoding scheme. Encoded data is then trans- mitted over a suitable transmission medium that connects all network elements. There are two encoding schemes, analog and digital. Analog encoding propagates analog signals representing analog data such as sound waves and voice data. Digital encoding, on the other hand, propagates digital signals representing either an analog or a digital signal representing digital data of binary streams by two voltage levels  Since our interest in this book is in digital networks, we will focus on the encoding of digital data.
### *Analog Encoding of Digital Data*
Recall that digital information is in the form of 1s or 0s. To send this information over some analog medium such as the telephone line, for example, which has lim- ited bandwidth, digital data needs to be encoded using modulation and demodulation to produce analog signals. The encoding uses a continuous oscillating wave, usually a sine wave, with a constant frequency signal called a carrier signal. The carrier has three modulation characteristics: amplitude, frequency, and phase shift. The scheme then uses a modem, a modulation–demodulation pair, to modulate and demodulate the data signal based on any one of the three carrier characteristics or a combination. The resulting wave is between a range of frequencies on both sides of the carrier as shown below [1]:
- Amplitude• modulation represents each binary value by a different amplitude of the carrier frequency. The absence of or low carrier frequency may represent a 0 and any other frequency then represents a 1. But this is a rather inefficient modulation technique and is therefore used only at low frequencies up to 1200 bps in voice grade lines.
- Frequency• modulation also represents the two binary values by two different frequencies close to the frequency of the underlying carrier. Higher frequencies represent a 1 and low frequencies represent a 0. The scheme is less susceptible to errors.
- Phase shift• modulation changes the timing of the carrier wave, shifting the carrier phase to encode the data. A 1 is encoded as a change in phase by 180 degrees and a 0 may be encoded as a 0 change in phase of a carrier signal. This is the most efficient scheme of the three and it can reach a transmission rate of up to 9600 bps.
### *Digital Encoding of Digital Data*
- In this encoding scheme, which offers the most common and easiest way to transmit digital signals, two binary digits are used to represent two different voltages. Within a computer, these voltages are commonly 0 volt and 5 volts. Another procedure uses two representation codes: nonreturn to zero level (NRZ-L), in which negative volt- age represents binary one and positive voltage represents binary zero, and nonreturn to zero, invert on ones (NRZ-I). See Figs. 1.6 and 1.7 for an example of these two codes. In NRZ-L, whenever a 1 occurs, a transition from one voltage level to another is used to signal the information. One problem with NRZ signaling techniques is the requirement of a perfect synchronization between the receiver and transmitter clocks. This is, however, reduced by sending a separate clock signal. There are yet other representations such as the Manchester and differential Manchester, which encode clock information along with the data. One may wonder why go through the hassle of digital encoding and transmis- sion. There are several advantages over its cousin, analog encoding. These include the following:
	- Plummeting costs of digital circuitry
	- More efficient integration of voice, video, text, and image
	- Reduction of noise and other signal impairment because of use of repeaters
	- Capacity of channels is utilized best with digital techniques
	- Better encryption and hence better security than in analog transmission

### *Multiplexing of Transmission Signals*

- Quite often during the transmission of data over a network medium, the volume of transmitted data may far exceed the capacity of the medium. Whenever this happens, it may be possible to make multiple signal carriers share a transmission medium. This is referred to as multiplexing. There are two ways in which multi- plexing can be achieved: time-division multiplexing (TMD) and frequency-division multiplexing (FDM). In FDM, all data channels are first converted to analog form. Since a number of signals can be carried on a carrier, each analog signal is then modulated by a separate and different carrier frequency, and this makes it possible to recover dur- ing the demultiplexing process. The frequencies are then bundled on the carrier. At the receiving end, the demultiplexer can select the desired carrier signal and use it to extract the data signal for that channel in such a way that the bandwidths do not overlap. FDM has an advantage of supporting full-duplex communication. TDM, on the other hand, works by dividing the channel into time slots that are allocated to the data streams before they are transmitted. At both ends of the trans- mission, if the sender and receiver agree on the time-slot assignments, then the receiver can easily recover and reconstruct the original data streams. So multiple digital signals can be carried on one carrier by interleaving portions of each signal in time


## *Transmission Media*

- As we have observed above, in any form of communication, there must be a medium through which the communication can take place. So network elements in a net- work need a medium in order to communicate. No network can function without a transmission medium because there would be no connection between the transmit- ting elements. The transmission medium plays a vital role in the performance of the network. In total, characteristic quality, dependability, and overall performance of a network depend heavily on its transmission medium. The transmission medium also determines a network’s capacity in realizing the expected network traffic, reli- ability for the network’s availability, size of the network in terms of the distance covered, and the transmission rate. Network transmission media can be either wired or wireless.
### *Wired Transmission Media*

- Wired transmission media are used in fixed networks physically connecting every network element. There are different types of physical media, the most common of which are copper wires, twisted pair, coaxial cables, and optical fibers.
- Copper wires have been traditionally used in communication because of their low resistance to electrical currents that allows signals to travel even further. But copper wires suffer interference from electromagnetic energy in the environment, and because of this, they must always be insulated.

- Twisted pair is a pair of wires consisting of insulated copper wire each wrapped around the other, forming frequent and numerous twists. Together, the twisted, insu- lated copper wires act as a full-duplex communication link. The twisting of the wires reduces the sensitivity of the cable to electromagnetic interference and also reduces the radiation of radio frequency noises that may interfere with nearby cables and electronic components. To increase the capacity of the transmitting medium, more than one pair of the twisted wires may be bundled together in a protective coating. Because twisted pairs were far less expensive, easy to install, and had a high qual- ity of voice data, they were widely used in telephone networks. However, because they are poor in upward scalability in transmission rate, distance, and bandwidth in LANs, twisted pair technology has been abandoned in favor of other technologies. Figure 1.8 shows a twisted pair.

- Coaxial cables are dual-conductor cables with a shared inner conductor in the core of the cable protected by an insulation layer and the outer conductor surround- ing the insulation. These cables are called coaxial because they share the inner conductor. The inner core conductor is usually made of solid copper wire, but at times can also be made up of stranded wire. The outer conductor commonly made of braided wires, but sometimes made of metallic foil or both, forms a protective tube around the inner conductor. This outer conductor is also further protected by another outer coating called the sheath. Figure 1.9 shows a coaxial cable. Coaxial cables are commonly used in television transmissions. Unlike twisted pairs, coaxial cables can be used over long distances. There are two types of coaxial cables: thin- net, a light and flexible cabling medium that is inexpensive and easy to install; and the thickent, which is thicker and harder to break and can carry more signals through a longer distance than thinnet.
- Optical fiber is a small medium made up of glass and plastics and conducts an optical ray. This is the most ideal cable for data transmission because it can accommodate extremely high bandwidths and has few problems with electromag- netic interference that coaxial cables suffer from. It can also support cabling for several kilometers. The two disadvantages of fiber-optic cables, however, are cost and installation difficulty. As shown in Fig. 1.10, a simple optical fiber has a central core made up of thin fibers of glass or plastics. The fibers are protected by a glass or plastic coating called a cladding. The cladding, though made up of the same materi- als as the core, has different properties that give it the capacity to reflect back the core rays that tangentially hit on it. The cladding itself is encased in a plastic jacket. The jacket protects the inner fiber from external abuses such as bending and abra- sions. Optical fiber cables transmit data signals by first converting them into light signals. The transmitted light is emitted at the source from either a light emitting diode (LED) or an injection laser diode (ILD). At the receiving end, the emitted rays are received by a photo detector that converts them back to the original form.

### *Wireless Communication*

Wireless communication and wireless networks have evolved as a result of rapid development in communication technologies, computing, and people’s need for mobility. Wireless networks fall in one of the following three categories depending on distance as follows:

- **Restricted Proximity Network• :** This network involves local area networks (LANs) with a mixture of fixed and wireless devices. 
- **Intermediate/Extended Network:•** This wireless network is actually made up of two fixed LAN components joined together by a wireless component. The bridge may be connecting LANs in two nearby buildings or even further. 
- **Mobile Network:•** This is a fully wireless network connecting two network elements. One of these elements is usually a mobile unit that connects to the home network (fixed) using cellular or satellite technology. These three types of wireless networks are connected using basic media such as infrared, laser beam, narrow-band and spread-spectrum radio, microwave, and satellite communication. 
- **Infrared:** During an infrared transmission, one network element remotely emits and transmits pulses of infrared light that carry coded instructions to the receiving network element. As long as there is no object to stop the transmitted light, the receiver gets the instruction. Infrared is best used effectively in a small confined area, within 100 feet, for example, a television remote communicating with the tele- vision set. In a confined area such as this, infrared is relatively fast and can support high bandwidths of up to 10 Mbps. 
- **High-Frequency Radio:** During a radio communication, high-frequency elec- tromagnetic radio waves or radio frequency commonly referred to as RF transmis- sions are generated by the transmitter and are picked up by the receiver. Because the range of radio frequency band is greater than that of infrared, mobile computing elements can communicate over a limited area without both transmitter and receiver being placed along a direct line of sight; the signal can bounce off light walls, build- ings, and atmospheric objects. RF transmissions are very good for long distances when combined with satellites to refract the radio waves.
- **Microwave:** Microwaves are a higher-frequency version of radio waves but whose transmissions, unlike those of the radio, can be focused in a single direction. Microwave transmissions use a pair of parabolic antennas that produce and receive narrow, but highly directional signals. To be sensitive to signals, both the transmit- ting and receiving antennas must focus within a narrow area. Because of this, both the transmitting and receiving antennas must be carefully adjusted to align the trans- mitted signal to the receiver. Microwave communication has two forms: terrestrial, when it is near ground, and satellite microwave. The frequencies and technologies employed by these two forms are similar but with notably distinct differences. 
- **Laser:** Laser light can be used to carry data for several thousand yards through air and optical fibers. But this is possible only if there are no obstacles in the line of sight. Lasers can be used in many of the same situations as microwaves, and like microwaves, laser beams must be refracted when used over long distances.
